Website Description:

 This website is designed to streamline user management and provide a convenient platform for both staff and management users.

Key Features:

User Roles: There are two distinct user roles:

Staff Users: These users can log in to the website and manage their own profiles. After logging in, they can click on the "Edit Profile" tab in the sidebar to update their information.

Management Users: Management users have broader privileges. They can edit the profiles of any user on the platform, making it easy to oversee and manage the entire user base.

Accessing the Website:
To access the website locally, simply run the command python manage.py runserver, and you can visit it at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your web browser.

Admin Interface:
For administrative tasks, we provide an admin interface accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin.

You can log in using the credentials:
Email: admin@gmail.com
Password: @megatron

In the admin interface, you can manage users and models efficiently.
My Django website was built with simplicity and efficiency in mind. It offers a secure and user-friendly experience for staff and management users alike, enabling them to manage profiles and perform administrative tasks with ease.
